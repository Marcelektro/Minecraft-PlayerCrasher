# Minecraft Player Crasher
Crash Minecraft Players XDD

Important: Make good use of it! It's mean to crash innocents :(

Command usage: /crash (player) (method).
Available methods: explosion, position

Tested on 1.8.9, 1.12.2, 1.16, 1.16.4;
Currently crashes any client: Forge, BLC, Lunar, BlazingPack, marCloudClient, Flux, Aristois, Huzuni, RemixClient, LiquidBounce(forge).

You can code your own methods to crash, just send a packet with giant values as args such as Double.MAX_VALUE.
This exploit technically can be patched, but probably will never be. Just make player position double instead of integer. However there are other like explosion. That one probably can't be fixed. So you can own your players omg. That sounds bad...
